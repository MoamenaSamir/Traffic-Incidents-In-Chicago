# TRAFFIC CRASHES IN POWER BI

## PURPOSE
This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Chicago traffic incidents using Power BI. Leveraging a dataset containing detailed information about crashes, the project seeks to provide insights into various aspects of traffic accidents. The dataset includes various attributes such as crash date, speed limits, weather conditions, and injuries sustained.

## OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of this project are:
- To visualize and analyze traffic patterns in Chicago.
- To identify contributing factors to traffic accidents.
- To provide actionable insights for enhancing road safety and traffic management in Chicago.

## KEY FEATURES OR COMPONENTS
The dataset includes detailed crash information, such as the date and time of crashes, speed limits, weather conditions, and the number of fatalities. These components are crucial for understanding the dynamics of traffic accidents and their contributing factors.

## TARGET AUDIENCE OR BENEFICIARIES
The primary beneficiaries of this project are government authorities and agencies responsible for traffic management and road safety. The insights derived from this analysis can help these entities develop strategies to improve road safety and reduce the incidence of traffic accidents.

## METHODOLOGY OR APPROACH
The methodology for this project involves several key steps:
1. **Data Import**: Import the dataset as a CSV file into Power BI.
2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**:
   - Remove empty values to ensure data completeness.
   - Change data types as necessary to maintain consistency.
   - Replace inconsistent values to ensure data accuracy.
   - Rename columns for better clarity and understanding.
3. **Data Visualization**: Utilize Power BI to create interactive visualizations that provide insights into the dataset.

## RESULTS
The analysis revealed several significant findings:
- The year 2018 had the highest car fatality rate in Chicago.
- Parked motor vehicles were identified as the most common cause of accidents.

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES
The expected outcome of this project is to enhance traffic safety in Chicago by providing actionable insights derived from the analysis. These insights can help government authorities implement more effective traffic management strategies and improve overall road safety.
